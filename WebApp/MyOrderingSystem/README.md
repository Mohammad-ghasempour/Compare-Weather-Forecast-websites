# Backlog Functional

<!-- - Data should be validated and stored in a browser database (We will later on sync data from this database to backend) -->

- Unit test is important! Unit test should be present where is needed
  <!-- - Data should be synced to a MongoDb database (Through a small NodeJS) -->
    <!-- [link](<(https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose)>)
    (The synchronization should be executed each hour) -->
